<p>Greatest story I have ever heard. It is hard to have faith. But I respect my parents who are vary religious. And find it very curious that the people most militantly against Jesusâ€™s teachings go to yoga, attend seminars, etc trying to learn how to live. When that is what the Bible tells us more than anything. He who does not believe but follows the Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven? Something like that. I should probably write that one down</p>
