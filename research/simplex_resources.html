<p>Simplex algorithm from the perspective of SMT solvers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>urgent!</strong> It seems I have neglected the SMT solver part of the simplex algorithm used in reluplex. We only use <em>phase one</em> simplex since we are only checking if the equations are satisifiable or unsatisifiable. This is usually followed by <em>phase two</em> simplex where we optimize a cost function.</p>
<p>The DPLL(T) and splitting on demand mechanisms are used to make decisions. So while simplex checks satisifiablity, it does not explain how we choose to pivot, update, or assign. That is deligated by the DPLL(T). It seems to me that the DPLL is what we are should try to optimize in hardware, then, rather than the simplex algorithm.</p>
<p><a href="../pdfs/DPLL.pdf">Short discription of DPLL</a>.</p>
<p>Still on a journey of figuring this stuff out. It all depends on what the code does. But I am grateful for my opprotunity to do this.</p>
<p>According to the paper <a href="../pdfs/reluplex_extended.pdf">Reluplex</a> and the highly cited supplementary material on linear programming by <a href="../pdfs/linear_programming.pdf">Professor Vanderbei</a>.</p>
<p>Here is an <a href="../pdfs/linear_programming_new.pdf">improved version</a> with better examples and different notation, as well as <a href="https://vanderbei.princeton.edu/307/lectures.html">companion slides</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a very simple explanation of the simplex algorithm by an <a href="https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~jsobel/172af04/simplexsummary.pdf">econ prof at ucsd</a>.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="../pdfs/cool_paper.pdf">cool thesis</a> by a masters student at UCLA that <em>could</em> serve as a basis for this project. I do want to implement simplex in hardware and show that verification can be faster if we develop on asic, fpga.</p>
<p>There is also an <a href="../pdfs/fpgs_DNN.pdf">introductory paper</a> on fpgas relating to nueral networks by one of my TAs. What I am getting at is, that I want to just start reading these things for fun. And once I have a good amount of knowledge about verification and specifically machine learning verification I can implement the project without stopping midway and having to review fundamentals.</p>
<p>How did I edit this?</p>
<p>Here is a tutorial about pandoc markdown: <a href="http://www.speakon.org.uk/MarkupBinder/beta/docs/Markdown/Pandoc_Markdown_vs_standard_Markdown.html">tutorial</a>.</p>
